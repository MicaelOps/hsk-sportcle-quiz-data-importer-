# hsk-sporcle-quiz-data-importer-
A .csv data generator to import HSK Wordlists for sporcle quiz creator

I am learning chinese and no one created hsk3, hsk4 hsk5 quizzes on sporcle for the new HSK requirements. So I had to create this to quickly create all the quizzes

Wordlists were copied from https://mandarinbean.com/new-hsk-3-word-list

This only works for wordlists in the format:
"1 \t 爱心 \t àixīn \t love"

If it ever becomes necessary, I will do a more general version to support multiple types.

Arguments:
--filename hsk3wordlist.txt --word_group_len 155
